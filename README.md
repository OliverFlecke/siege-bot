This repository contains a crate for connecting to Ubisoft's API to retreive statistics about players in Rainbow Six Siege, along with a Discord bot for interacting it with it.

## Build and running

To run the Discord bot, the following environment variables have to be set.

```sh
export UBISOFT_EMAIL="<email for ubisoft account>"
export UBISOFT_PASSWORD="<password for ubisoft account>"
export DISCORD_TOKEN="<token for discord bot>"
```

The bot can then be run with from the root of the repository with `cargo run siege-bot`.

In order to link Discord IDs to Ubisoft accounts between restarts, the bot will store these relationships in a json file. It will first look relative to itself for `.players.json` or secondly at `/config/.players.json`. The second one was added to support mounting the file inside a container.

## Running inside container

To run the bot as a container, the following comand can be used:

```sh
docker run --env-file .env -v ${PWD}/config:/config --name siege-bot -d ghcr.io/oliverflecke/siege-bot
```

Note that the format for the `.env` file should just be a `key=value` pair on each line (no `export` or qoutes).

The `config` mount is optional, but necessary to persist players' links between their Ubisoft accounts and Discord ID.

## Development

All relevant checks for the code will be done and validated through Github workflows, but to avoid extra runs a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) config is included in the repository. Install the tool and run `pre-commit install` to setup git hooks to run before each commit. The checks can also be run manually with `pre-commit run`.

### Tests

To run all the tests, the environment variables for Ubisoft have to set, as it is required to testing the interaction with the API. Some of these have been marked as `ignored` for now to not run them in the pipeline. This is mostly because Ubisoft do not like me logging in from many different places and closes the account ðŸ˜«
